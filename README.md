# Tree
Tree is a Discord bot that can be found on the [Superjombombo Community](discord.gg/sjb)

## Description
Tree is a bot focused on entertainment and games with a few utility commands. Tree is constantly updated with new and interesting things to play around with!

## Things used in Tree
Tree was made using a Discord API library called Eris. It also utilizes a database system called PostgreS.

## Features
- A random number generator!
- A way to disallow the use of certain commands in a channel!
- Lockpicker, a game where you pick locks by solving challenges to advance!
- Guild-specific prefixes that guild administrators can change!

... and much, much more to come!

## Can I have Tree on my server?
Tree is currently not publicly distributed because it's under heavy development and is missing lots of key features. I plan to make it a public bot at some point, though, so check back soon!
